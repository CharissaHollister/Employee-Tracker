# Employee Tracker CLI

Authored by Charissa Hollister 07/05/2022

## Description
Employee Tracker is a command line application that can be used to track, add, and update your work force database. Database contains 3 tables to track and manager Departments, Roles, and Employees. _npm start_ can get the team organized and ready for success.

## Instructions
On initial set up it will be required that the user enters their specific login information in the db/connections.js file, install the npm packages, and run the mysql files db.sql and schema.sql to create a clean database.  
Once the database is present on the local computer all that is needed to begin the CLI is to enter _npm start_  
Users can continue to track, add, and update for as many loops as is necessary.  
Choosing quit from the main menu and entering Ctrl-C will exit the program.
